Getting Around in Japan
Japan boasts one of the world’s most efficient and reliable transportation systems. The iconic Shinkansen (bullet trains) connect major cities at incredible speeds, while local trains and subways are punctual and clean. Visitors can take advantage of the Japan Rail Pass to save on long-distance travel.

Buses and taxis are widely available, especially in rural areas, and Suica or Pasmo cards make commuting seamless in cities. Signs and announcements in English make navigation surprisingly easy, even for first-time visitors.

Top Things to Do in Japan
Japan offers a wide range of unforgettable experiences. In Tokyo, explore towering skyscrapers, quirky neighborhoods like Harajuku, and world-class dining. Head to Kyoto for peaceful temples, bamboo groves, and traditional tea ceremonies. Adventure seekers can hike Mount Fuji, ski in Niseko, or relax in natural hot springs (onsen).

Other must-sees include the historic Hiroshima Peace Memorial, deer-friendly Nara Park, and the beautiful island of Miyajima. For something unique, attend a sumo match, wander through neon-lit Osaka, or visit art islands like Naoshima.

Culture, Customs & Etiquette
Japanese culture is rich, respectful, and deeply rooted in tradition. Visitors are often struck by the politeness and orderliness of daily life. Take your shoes off when entering homes and certain restaurants, bow as a sign of respect, and be mindful of quiet public spaces.

Cultural festivals, such as Hanami (cherry blossom viewing) in spring and Gion Matsuri in summer, provide a deep look into Japan’s community spirit. From ancient kabuki theater to modern anime culture, Japan's heritage and creativity are always on display.
